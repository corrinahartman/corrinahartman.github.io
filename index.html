                                    <p>Debut is Taylor Swift's first full length album and is what started her career.
                                        The album is fun, young, and country. Very country. Soulful songs like Teardrops
                                        on my guitar show the emotional depth she possesed at a young age, and instant
                                        hits like Our Song had everyone in love with Taylor from the beginning. </p>

                                    <p>Fearless is Taylor's second studio album, but was her first re-record. No album
                                        has upgrade as much as fearless has by her rerecords. The album solidified
                                        Taylor as a star with classics like Love Story and You Belong With Me. Still two
                                        of her most popular songs. With a pop/country mix, Fearless is phenomenal. </p>

                                    <p>Speak Now is where Taylor shows her song writting talent. The album is solely
                                        written by her, and boasts songs that are deeply personal and emotional. Taylor
                                        had gone through a lot of public ridicule, and this was her expression of what
                                        had occurred. Songs like Dear John, Innocent and Last Kiss are some of her
                                        saddest and most gut wrenching songs to this day.</p>

                                    <p>Red (Taylor's Version) is the it girl. No rerecord has had the attention that Red
                                        got. Taylor's journey into pop began with Red, which had huge commercial hits,
                                        and with the rerecord, All Too Well 10 minute version got it's time to shine.
                                        Winning best music video, ATW 10 minute version is wildly regarded as Taylor's
                                        best song.</p>

                                    <p>Taylor went dark for a full two years, she was not seen in public, no new music,
                                        nothing. And then 2016 hit and she dropped Look What You Made Me Do, her
                                        decisive and shocking return to the scene. Reputation tells a story about
                                        falling in love in private, and sharing how public opinion affects someone.</p>

                                    <p>The album about being in love. But it is more than that. It's the fun freedom
                                        that love can bring, but also the miscommunication and struggles in a
                                        relationship. Not all romantic. This album has range, and while it is not the
                                        most celebrated of her albums, songs like Cruel Summer are getting their time to
                                        shine.</p>

                                    <p>Covid might have sucked... But it gave us folklore. Taylor takes a pause from
                                        telling her own stories and instead shows her song writting skills by writting
                                        about fictional situations. This album is lyrically Taylor's best work, and
                                        while not as upbeat, it is arguably her best work.</p>

                                    <p>The sister album to folklore, it was not as popular at the time, but had become a
                                        fan favorite. Taylor shows off more of her song writting and talent as a singer
                                        in evermore, specifically in the title track, where her vocals are beutifully
                                        highlited. The slower songs masterfully show that Taylor has insane range, from
                                        pop to indie to country, Taylor does it all.</p>

                                    <p>The album that broke every streaming record imaginable. Midnights is about
                                        different midnights in Taylor's life, and it spans a variety of styles, but
                                        really finds itself in pop anthems like Karma and Anti-Hero. Taylor does pop in
                                        the way Shakespere does plays, its art.</p>
